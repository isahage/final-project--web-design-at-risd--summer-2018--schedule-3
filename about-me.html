  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <h3>hello!</h3>
  <p>My name is Isa Hage, I'm twenty something and a studio art major and buisness minor at Skidmore College. I love Pablo Picasso, oil-paint, and mac-n-cheese. I dabble between all art mediums, but my absolute favorites are painting and Adobe Illustrator. I'm currently located in both Boston, Massachusetts and Saratoga Springs, New York. I love the Red Sox and still support the Patriots post diflate-gate. I have experience with book, logo, and website design, as well as with creating marketing reports and campaigns.</p>
